# Thesis

In our thesis work, we basically incorporate important and most demanding topics of data-mining those are Weighted patterns for building a new methodology focusing on the recent demand of users. Our target is simple but important and useful, is to introduce some techniques that help to perfectly capture data stream where data items are uncertain and also propose mining techniques that ensure only nd interesting patterns depending on users need. As our prior knowledge we are the rst to deal with uncertain data streams to generate only interesting patterns which are less time consuming, appropriate for large dataset and also use less memory resources. In our thesis, we propose a new approach to mine frequent interesting items considering external weight. We named our approach Weighted Interesting Patterns Mining (WIPM)-growth approach. "The total number of frequency of a particular item in a given set of transactions."- This is called Intra- transaction Frequency. We can calculate CWS (Combined Weighted Support) by multiplying the sum of intra-transaction frequency with external weight divided by total length.
